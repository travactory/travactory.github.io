We are tech company that does all the magic behind tix.nl, the #2 flight ticket site in The Netherlands. We do also hotel booking and car rentals, in the future - more travel stuff. We are agile, open and transparent. We love new technologies, good atmosphere of work. What we don't like is corporate politics and procedures.

We like Java, Ruby and Coldfusion( ha ha Joke :) ). We practice MongoDB and MSSQL. We also try do use modern techniques where it makes sense.

We think that tools are important, that's why we use Jira, Confluence, Stash, Docker, Git and some other.
