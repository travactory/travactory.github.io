##In general

What we mainly do is Tix.nl

number of PV, UU, req/s, filghts, bookings.

We also do some other sites/products of our company: Gate1.nl ....... but in general we work only for our mother company, we do not sell anything to external companies neither software nor people.

##Core Values

We are transparent and open. We have flat structure that helps us keep communication quick and direct. We belive that it makes everybody involved in decision making.

## Tech

We like Java, Ruby, Angular and Coldfusion( ha ha joke :) ). We practice MongoDB and MSSQL(O.o). We also try do use modern techniques where it makes sense.

We think that tools are important, that's why we use Jira, Confluence, Stash, Slack, Docker, Git and some other.

##Agile

We also rely on agile methodolgies. We love scrum. We practice it and try to continously improve the process. We also think it is something more than just to have dailies and demos.

We continously experiment to prove or leave our concepts on the early stage. Agile methodolgies help us with that as well as tools like Optimizely.

##Other
We love to learn, we even give money to our employees to learn. Each person has his/her own growth budget, he/she decides on what she/he wants to spend it.
