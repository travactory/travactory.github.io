## In short

We are tech company that does all the magic behind [Tix.nl](tix.nl), the #2 flight ticket site in The Netherlands. We are also responsible for our other products like gate1.nl, ...... We work only for our mother company [Tix.nl](tix.nl), we do not sell anything to external companies neither software nor people.

We do also hotel booking and car rentals, in the future - more travel stuff. We are agile, open and transparent. We love new technologies, good atmosphere of work. What we don't like is corporate politics and procedures.

## Full story

Tix.nl was found in 2010 by Bjorn de Jager and Kristof Matthys and that's how our journey begun. Since then we deliver the best travel experience to our customers.

Through the time we expanded our activities to new markets. We are now present in Germany, Spain, Poland and UK. We also did not stopped with airline tickets only but added hotel bookings, car rentals and travel guides to make our offer complete for cutomers.

We have offices in Breda(Netherlands), Willemstad(Curaçao) and of course Gdańsk(Poland).

Our Gdańsk office is placed in newly built [Garnizon Office and Apartment Center](http://garnizon.pl/obiekty-biurowe.html). Great place to work and live (but we only work here trying to live at our homes :) ). It is also well connected.
