Yeah, we use Jekyll. Why not? It's real fun. Isn't it the easiest way to have a website? Together with Github Pages it makes great couple. Don't know easier way to do it.

We like Wordpress, we thought about WP, we know that it can do anything... but finally decided on Jekyll and are happy with it.

It is always better to write a post in emacs than in a browser :) That is why we like Jekyll more.
